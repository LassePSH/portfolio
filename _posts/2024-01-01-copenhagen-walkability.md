# Abstract
Understanding walking behavior in cities is critical to promoting physical activity and reducing reliance on fossil fuel-powered vehicles.
Individualsâ€™ experience of moving through the city is influenced by many factors, including the structure of the street network, the perception of safety, the accessibility of amenities, and the visual qualities of its built environment. 
Existing research has combined these elements into walkability indexes, which assess the pedestrian-friendliness of urban areas and are widely used in policy-making, academic research, and real estate.
