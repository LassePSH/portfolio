# Abstract
Understanding walking behavior in cities is critical to promoting physical activity and reducing reliance on fossil fuel-powered vehicles.
Individualsâ€™ experience of moving through the city is influenced by many factors, including the structure of the street network, the perception of safety, the accessibility of amenities, and the visual qualities of its built environment. 
Existing research has combined these elements into walkability indexes, which assess the pedestrian-friendliness of urban areas and are widely used in policy-making, academic research, and real estate.

# Walkability Index
To measure the desirability of a street segment, we compare the number of trips passing through it against the number of trips along neighboring streets that have similar directions.

The desirability score for a given segment $$i$$ can be computed by the z-score, where a postive score indicate a desirable street and a negative a non-desirable street.

$$
Z_i = {x_i - \mu_i \over \sigma_i}
$$

The Mean and standard deviation of trips along neighboring streets $$X_j$$ weighted by the difference in angle between $$i$$ and $$j$$.

$$
w_{ij} = 1 - \frac{|\theta_i - \theta_j|}{90^\circ}
$$

$$
\mu_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} x_j}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij}} 
$$

$$
\sigma_i = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} (x_j - \mu_i)^2}}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij}} 
$$

# The Model

## Network Features
In order to extract properties from the street network, we used a dual graph representation where streets are represented as nodes and intersection are edges.
In addition we applied street continuity, which allows the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges with aiffrence in angle below a fixed threshold.

## Enviormental Features
To capture the visual qualities we used the deep learning image model Segformer fine-tuned on the CityScapes dataset to compute a vector representation of each image that describes the environmental features from a given image $$I_i$$. The Segformer model outputs the density of $$18$$ different classes.

Each street segment contains multiple images. To get an average representation of the environmental features, an average across all vector representations from the Segformer model is computed from all the images related to the street segment:

## Results
Using data from the network features and enviormental features, we trained a gradient-boosting classification tree (XGBoost) to classify the desirability of a street segment.
