# Fractals in street networks

fractality are everywhere in nature..
are human structures also a part of natrual structured.
it is a know fact that street networks follow a powerlaw distribution and have fractal properties

The following figure shows the distribution 52 diffrent cities using dual graph representation with a directiong continuity approach.


It can be seen that there are 2 phase shift in the distribution around degree N where 
This indicate that there are a lower bound 

# Fractal in geometrical shapes

to futher understand this we kan compare this distribution to known geometrical fractals such as the sierpinski fractal.
The figure shows the dual graph representation of the sierpinski triangle.
