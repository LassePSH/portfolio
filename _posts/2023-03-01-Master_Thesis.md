This thesis explores how the acknowledgment of individuals can be quantitively mea
sured by exploiting the Reddit award system. The thesis primarily focuses on data from
the subreddit wallstreetbets, where we analyzed the social dynamics of the community us
ing network science and Natural Language Processing. We developed a Deep Learning
model that classifies awarded posts, using network features and the transformer model
ELECTRA. Finally, we explained some of the underlying social mechanisms within the
community, revealing a ”rich get richer” effect for the award system, where the probability
of receiving an award increases prior to the amount previously awarded posts. We also
investigate the impact of the network size on individuals’ identity within the community,
revealing that larger networks have different social dynamics, making it more challenging
for individuals to establish identity. Overall, this research provides insights into how repu
tation is formed and maintained within online communities and the factors that contribute
to it.
